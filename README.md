# vantaraX-v2

# VantaraX Voice Agent

A production-oriented outbound voice-agent system currently under active development.
It combines real-time telephony, speech recognition, multilingual TTS, LLM conversation control, lead qualification, and call transfers.

## Features
- **Ultra-Fast LLM**: Uses **Groq** running `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` for near-instant responses.
- **High-Quality Audio**: Uses **Deepgram** for both Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS).
- **SIP Trunking**: Integrated with **Vobiz** for PSTN connectivity.
- **Robust Configuration**: Centralized `config.py` for easy customization of prompts, models, and voices.

## Setup & Installation

### 1. Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+ (Recommended: 3.10.13)
- A [LiveKit Cloud](https://cloud.livekit.io/) account
- A [Deepgram](https://deepgram.com/) API Key
- A [Groq](https://groq.com/) API Key
- A SIP Provider (e.g., Vobiz)

### 2. Clone & Install
```bash
# Clone the repository
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd vantaraX-voice-agent

# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure Environment
Copy the example environment file and fill in your credentials:
```bash
    cp .env.example .env
nano .env  # Or open in your editor
```
**Required Variables:**
- `LIVEKIT_URL`, `LIVEKIT_API_KEY`, `LIVEKIT_API_SECRET`
- `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`
- `GROQ_API_KEY`
- `VOBIZ_SIP_*` variables (for outbound calls)

## Usage

### 1. Start the Agent
This runs the agent process which listens for room connections.
```bash
python agent.py start
```

### 2. Make an Outbound Call
In a **new terminal window** (ensure `venv` is active), run:
```bash
python make_call.py --to +91XXXXXXXXXX
```
*Note: The number must include the country code (e.g., +1 or +91).*

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Error: `model_decommissioned` (Groq/Llama)
**Cause:** The configured LLM model is no longer supported by Groq.
**Fix:**
1. Open `config.py`.
2. Update `GROQ_MODEL` to a supported model (e.g., `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` or `llama-3.1-8b-instant`).
3. **Restart `agent.py`** to apply changes.

### Error: `404 Not Found` (SIP Trunk)
**Cause:** The `SIP_TRUNK_ID` in `.env` is incorrect or doesn't exist in your LiveKit project.
**Fix:**
1. Run `python list_trunks.py` to see available trunks.
2. If none exist, run `python create_trunk.py` to create one.
3. Update `.env` with the correct ID.

### Error: `Address already in use` (Port 8081)
**Cause:** Another instance of `agent.py` is already running.
**Fix:**
1. Find the process: `lsof -i :8081`
2. Kill it: `kill -9 <PID>` or `pkill -f "python agent.py"`

### Error: `No module named 'certifi'` or other imports
**Cause:** Dependencies are missing.
**Fix:**
1. Ensure your virtual environment is active (`source venv/bin/activate`).
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### Error: Call Connects but No Audio
**Cause:** TTS (Text-to-Speech) failure or WebSocket issues.
**Fix:**
1. Check terminal logs for `APIStatusError`.
2. If using OpenAI TTS, ensure you have OpenAI credits.
3. Recommended: Switch to Deepgram TTS (set `TTS_PROVIDER=deepgram` in `.env`).

## Project Structure
- `agent.py`: Main application logic.
- `config.py`: Central configuration for prompts, models, and constants.
- `make_call.py`: Script to initiate outbound calls.
- `create_trunk.py` / `setup_trunk.py`: Utilities for SIP trunk management.
- `tests/`: Conversation, recovery, spreadsheet, and voice-quality checks.
- `docs/`: Architecture, telephony, and testing documentation.

## Development status

This project is not yet production-ready. It is intended for development, evaluation, and controlled testing. Do not use it for real customer outreach without completing security, consent, observability, reliability, and compliance reviews.

## Security

Never commit `.env`, `credentials.json`, API keys, SIP passwords, private keys, recordings, transcripts, or customer data. Use `.env.example` as the sanitized configuration template.
